            <h2>Introduction</h2>
             
            <p>
                <img class="introicon" src="images/tumblr.png" alt="tumblr icon"> A social media tool and a microblogging platform that allows its users to publish microblogs or short blog posts. This application or software can also be explained simply by describing it like Facebook, Twitter and a blog e.g. WordPress and Blogger. It was also known as "Tumblelogging" that went before Tumblr itself. Microblogging also means people post quickly and a small paragraph compared to a typical diary entry style of a traditional blog. Tumblr was first created in 2007 by David Karp and later, it was purchased by Yahoo! for $1.1 billion in 2013. He was inspired by two blog designs created by other people. His style was new and advanced so that you can personalise your account. This is why Tumblr attracts teens because it has appealing features where they can express themselves and connect to like-minded people. It is also popular for its heavily customized pages and profile with a limited design. You can also share anything in Tumblr such as music, videos, images and even gifs. This is the reason why Tumblr is an attractive application for  business people who are strongly interested in accentuating their brand. Their business page can be easily recognised and followed by users who are interested in their work and ideas by liking, sharing and commenting in their blogs. Tumblr is not only for business and entertainment purposes as it also a great source if you want to be inspired by something you want to do.

             <h2>How to use the app/tool</h2>
             
             <p>
                 On Tumblr a user's primary use of the platform is to create Posts on their blogs of differing formats. Tumblr provides seven post formats for users to found on their blog's dashboard. All post formats are opened by clicking its respective symbol on the dash or through the post button at the top right.
             </p>
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse1.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <p>
                The first and most basic of these is a text post which is found on all blogging platforms which involves creating a post of mainly text. Firstly a title is given to the top of the post and the following section is for the main text content of the post with the included ability to integrate images, videos and GIFs into this section. These posts are flexible and can be used for a multitude of tasks.
             </p>
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse2.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <p>
                The next post format is a photo post which involves choosing an image/images(either uploaded from the device or from the internet by pasting a URL) as the primary content of the post. This image/images are then followed by a caption section in which you can type out a caption for the image which can integrate images/videos/GIFs into the caption. This format can be used to showcase work such as artwork or photography.
             </p>
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse3.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse4.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <p>
                 The next posting format is the quote post which makes a large font quote the primary content followed by a Source section to source your quote or add extra information. This format is not commonly used and does not have a lot of academic uses.
             </p>
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse5.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <p>
                The next post format is a link post which allows users to share a link as their main content for the post while also giving the link a personalized/external title and summary. Tumblr also allows users to add a description to their post similar to most of the other post formats. This can be used to fluidly link to external websites directly from a blog. 
             </p>
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse6.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <p>
                The next post format is the chat post which is used to transcribe a conversation into a blog post. This is accomplished through the automatic formatting applied to the text in the post. Following the title, all content in the main section of the post receives this formatting. All text on a line before a colon is bolded and text that follows is left normal. This format is mainly for comedic or documentary purposes and thus has little academic use.
             </p>
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse7.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <p>
                 The next post format is the audio post which integrates an audio track as the primary content of the post. This audio track is either sourced directly through Tumblr's search engine which sources from Spotify or Soundcloud, by pasting an audio tracks URL into Tumblr or by manually uploading audio from your device. Users can also add a text caption to the audio with integrated images/videos/GIFs. This post can be used to share songs, podcasts or any other audio one would wish to share as long as it does not violate copyright law or Tumblr's Terms and Conditions.
             </p>
             
             <img class="howtousepics" src="images/howtouse8.png" alt="screenshot of tumblr">
             
             <p>
                The final post format is a video post which integrates a video as the primary content of the post. Videos can be sourced through URLs or uploaded directly from a users device. Videos sourced through URLs are fully integrated into the post if the URLs source is compatible such as from YouTube. Similar to an audio post this format could be used to share any type of video content as long as it does not violate copyright or Terms and Conditions.

You must need the consent of a parent or a guardian if you are under 16.

             <h3 class ="h3header">Ways of staying safe when using Tumblr</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Keep your blog private
                    If you decided to use tumblr for your own self-use only and don't want anyone to see it, you can set your blogs to invisible. Just by doing this other users cannot be able to search it even if they will try it with a regular search engine.</li>
 
                    <li>It's difficult to take down your content by the Tumblr administrators because the other users share it faster than they can stop it as you cannot control what other people do with their accounts.</li>
 
                    <li>Report explicit contents
                    You can click the "Flag This Post" in Tumblr if you see something unnecessary or posts that doesn't belong to Tumblr. You can also fill out a report if you couldn't flag the post because it's in someone's personal blog.</li>
                    
                    <li>Block anyone who may be bothering you.
                    Tumblr can also block anonymous users for you by blocking the address they use.</li>

                    <li>Password: Never reuse a password and always make sure to change it regularly.</li>
                </ol>

Over 748 lines of sensitive information was exposed to the public and even the first people who  used the platform could access administrator privileges for any account just by adding "admin" to a URL. Tumblr tried to fix the issue throughout the years to keep it safer. Unfortunately, due to constant new threats, Tumblr and any social network, is not 100% safe anymore.</p>
             
                <h3 class ="h3header">Tumblr banned adult content 2018</h3>

            <p>
                Tumblr is a content sharing application which makes it a useful resource tool for people to engage with professional work and to learn more about how others view and work. Along with this, there are many teachers that have accounts dedicated to teaching for and educators own classroom and courses such as <a class="tumblrlink" href="https://www.teachingwithtumblr.tumblr.com/">Teaching with Tumblr</a>, <a class="tumblrlink" href="https://www.classroomcollective.tumblr.com/">Classroom Collective</a> and <a class="tumblrlink" href="https://www.https://187days.tumblr.com/">Classroom Collective</a>.

Tumblr also invites people to learn about not only new and exciting art forms or styles but also about people's opinions of those styles and forms, as under posts there is the opportunity for commenting your thoughts. Through this, we can learn about so much more of people's experiences and other pieces of knowledge that the commenter has put under.
