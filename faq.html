    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    
    <div class="containerfaq"><p>Below is some frequently asked questions by people who are new to social media. So have a read here before you submit anything on the form as if may have been already answered!</p></div>
    
    <div class="containerfaq">
        
        <h3 class="textfaq"> Do I Have to Be on Every Social Network?</h3>
        
        <p>No, it is up to yourself in what social medias you join. If you were to join all you'd be caught up in them 24/7. There are a lot out there. So we would suggest to pick your favourites and join them. You could always join a good amount first and see which you like the best and delete some then that you don't use. </p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="containerfaq">
        
        <h3 class="textfaq">Do My Social Media Usernames Have to Be The Same?</h3>
        
        <p>Not always, but it is better to keep them similar if you can't get the exact same! It just makes it easier for people to find you, they can look up the same username on every site and you'll come up. It just makes it easier on people you know.</p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="containerfaq">
        
        <h3 class="textfaq">How Often Should I Post?</h3>
        
        <p>It depends. There is nothing to say you can't post every minute but it will spam peoples home pages so I wouldn't suggest it. But you do what is best for yourself. Post once a day, a week or even a month. Whatever works best for yourself.</p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="containerfaq">
        
        <h3 class="textfaq">Do The Amount Of Followers I Have Matter?</h3>
        
        <p>No! It is just a number, I've seen people with thousands of followers and they don't get the likes or comments as a lot of their followers are not active or they follow so many people they can't keep up with everyone. Whatever number you have doesn't matter as long as you are happy with who is following you.</p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="containerfaq">
        
        <h3 class="textfaq">Can I Stop Someone From Following Me?</h3>
        
        <p>Yes, some social medias have a way to turn your account private so you have to accept people to follow you so you can always decline them. You can also block accounts so that way they can't see your account and they can't follow you. </p>
